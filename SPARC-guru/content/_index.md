# **Welcome to the Quilted tutorial**
We will be demonstrating different features from the [**SPARC**](https://sparc.science/) project. The goal will be to project the 2D locations of neurites in the rat stomach onto a 3D scaffhold of the organ. The data points and the 3D scaffhold will be pulled from **SPARC** datasets. Because the data is [**FAIR**](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) we will be combining three different datasets of the spatial distribution of the vagal afferents and efferents. 

You can find out more about the **SPARC** and **FAIR** data in the [About]({{< ref "About" >}} "About") page. If you already know all about it, then head to the [Getting started]({{< ref "Getting_started" >}} "Getting_started") page to get your hands dirty!
